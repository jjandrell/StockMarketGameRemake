## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Domain Models
- **Stock**: Represents a tradeable stock with price history
- **Player**: Manages player state, stock holdings, and transactions
- **Game**: Controls overall game flow and market conditions
- **MarketEvent**: Represents news and events that impact stocks
- **HighScore**: Tracks top player performances

### Database Design
- SQLite for local storage
- Tables for games, players, stocks, market events, high scores
- Simple migration system for schema updates

### UI Architecture
- MVVM pattern for WPF implementation
- Separation of presentation from business logic
- Reusable components for common elements

### AI Implementation
- Rule-based AI for initial implementation
- Different personalities and risk profiles
- Potential integration with LLM APIs for advanced behavior

### Multiplayer Architecture
- Local multiplayer (hot-seat) initially
- Consider peer-to-peer networking for remote play
- Simple chat functionality between players

## Development Approach

### Modular Development
- Focus on completing one component before moving to the next
- Ensure each module is testable in isolation
- Regular integration testing

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for key scenarios
- Manual testing for UI and user experience

### Version Control
- Feature branches for major components
- Regular commits with descriptive messages
- Code reviews for critical functionality

### Risk Management
- Focus on core gameplay first
- Defer advanced features until basics are solid
- Regular testing to catch issues early
